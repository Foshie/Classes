Each of the public tests here should be compiled and linked against your
mergesort implementation.  Testing should be done using diff in a manner
similar to previous projects:

  ./public01 | diff - public01.output

Note that on the submit server, there is a 0-point "public test 5" that
checks to make sure you have submitted all the required files.  If you
are missing the REPORT file, you will fail this test; while you won't
lose any points for failing the test, you will not receive the 25 points
that the REPORT answers are worth, so it will be to your benefit to make
sure you're passing that test.
